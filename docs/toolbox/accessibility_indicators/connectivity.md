# Heatmap - Connectivity
A color-coded map to visualize the connectivity of locations within an area of interest ([AOI](../../../further_reading/glossary#area-of-interest-aoi "What is an AOI?")).

## 1. Explanation

Visualized as a color-coded hexagonal grid, the heatmap takes into account real-world transport and street networks to compute connectivity. After specifying a *routing type* (Walk, Bicycle, etc.) and *travel time limit*, the result will display a color-coded hexagonal grid representing the relative connectivity of all locations within the specified AOI.

Unlike our other heatmaps which focus on visualizing the accessibility to specific points (such as [POI](../../../further_reading/glossary#point-of-interest-poi "What is a POI?")) or amenities from surrounding areas, connectivity-based heatmaps represent the overall connectivity of an area. This means that all locations within your AOI are considered to be destinations, and for each location, its "connectivity" represents the geographic area (within and outside the AOI) from which the location is accessible, considering the specified *routing type* and *travel time limit*.

:::info 

Heatmaps are available in certain regions. Upon selecting a `Routing type`, a **geofence** will be displayed on the map to highlight supported regions.

If you would like to perform analyses beyond this geofence, feel free to [contact us](https://plan4better.de/en/contact/ "Contact us"). We would be happy to discuss further options.

## 2. Example use cases

 - How well connected is the street, footpath, or cycle lane network in a specific area?

 - How do locations within an AOI compare in terms of connectivity across the different modes of transport?

 - Are there barriers, gaps, or islands within the street network that hinder connectivity?

 - Does the existing transport network provide equitable access across the AOI?

## 4. Technical details

### Calculation

For each cell of the hexagonal grid (within your AOI), the full extent of surrounding cells from which it is accessible are identified. These surrounding cells may be located outside of your AOI but must be within areas accessible according to the specified `Travel time limit` and `Routing type`.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src={require('/img/toolbox/accessibility_indicators/heatmaps/connectivity_based/heatmap_connectivity_infographic.png').default} alt="Extent of cells from where destination cell within AOI is accessible." style={{ maxHeight: "400px", maxWidth: "500px", alignItems:'center'}}/>
</div>

Connectivity formula:

![Connectivity Formula](/img/toolbox/accessibility_indicators/heatmaps/connectivity_based/connectivity_formula.png "Connectivity Formula")

Where ***i*** is a travel time step and ***n*** is the travel time limit. This function computes the total geographic area (in sq. meters) from which the destination cell in your AOI is accessible.

### Classification
To classify the connectivity levels that were computed for each grid cell (for color-coded visualization), a classification based on quantiles is used by default. However, various other classification methods may be used instead. Read more in the **[Data Classification Methods](../../map/layer_style/attribute_based_styling#data-classification-methods)** section of the *Attribute-based Styling* page.

### Visualization 

Heatmaps in GOAT utilize **[Uber's H3 grid-based](../further_reading/glossary#h3-grid)** solution for efficient computation and easy-to-understand visualization. Behind the scenes, a pre-computed travel time matrix for each *routing type* utilizes this solution and is queried and further processed in real-time to compute accessibility and produce a final heatmap.

The resolution and dimensions of the hexagonal grid used depend on the selected *routing type*:

#### Walk
- Resolution: 10
- Average hexagon area: 11285.6 m²
- Average hexagon edge length: 65.9 m

#### Bicycle
- Resolution: 9
- Average hexagon area: 78999.4 m²
- Average hexagon edge length: 174.4 m

#### Pedelec
- Resolution: 9
- Average hexagon area: 78999.4 m²
- Average hexagon edge length: 174.4 m

#### Car
- Resolution: 8
- Average hexagon area: 552995.7 m²
- Average hexagon edge length: 461.4 m

### Example of calculation

The following example illustrates the computation of a connectivity-based heatmap for a specific AOI. The heatmap is computed for a `Travel time limit` of 15 minutes and a `Routing type` of `Walk`.
